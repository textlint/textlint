# Creation
There are two ways to create an `object` in JavaScript:

1. literal

    ```js
    var object = {};
     // Yes, simply a pair of curly braces!

    ```
    > ***Note:*** this is the **recommended** way.

2. and object-oriented

    ```js
    var object = new Object();

    ```
    > ***Note:*** it's almost like Java.
